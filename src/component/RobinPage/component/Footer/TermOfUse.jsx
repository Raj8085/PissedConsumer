                  updates, etc.) on the Site either anonymously or having
                  registered an account with Us. Please note, however, that if
                  You are commenting on a review anonymously and are including a
                  link in Your comment, that link will be masked. In order to
                  have links in Your comments displayed as unmasked, You need to

                  one registered user over user&apos;s life-time on the Site. As

                  expedite a resolution process. By creating an account or
                  providing Your email address, You agree to receive certain
                  communications in connection with the Site and the Services,

                  to make a call to a representative of a company of Your

                  and that We have a corresponding telephone number to make such
                  a call. In addition to connecting the call for You, We offer a
                  service to United States-based users which produces a written
                  transcript of Your call with the representative which is
                  produced by an artiï¬ÂÂcial intelligence tool. By using this
                  call functionality, You acknowledge and expressly consent to
                  the recording and transcription of the call, and You consent
                  to Our interception of such call. You agree to inform all
                  parties to the call that recording and transcription are
                  taking place, and understand that if any participant objects,
                  You must immediately terminate the call. By proceeding with
                  the call, You consent to the collection and processing of Your
                  transcript as described in these Terms and Our Privacy Policy
                  which is an integral part of these Terms.

                  If You wish to create a new account, You may do it at any
                  time. You can edit or remove Your prior posts. If You wish to
                  edit or remove Your prior posts, You can do so through Your
                  user profile, by submitting a notarized letter, a court order
                  or by participating in an LVP. You shall acknowledge that the
                  same rules apply to removal of cross-posts of Your posts from
                  Our pages in any and all social networks. For more details
                  regarding removal of information please visit Our FAQ for
                  Consumers and FAQ for Companies. You can add supplemental
                  information to the review if the review was created under Your
                  account (please also see Our Privacy Policy, section
                  “Cookies”). We are a provider of the Site, which is an
                  interactive computer service as those terms are defined under
                  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Thus, We will
                  not be treated as the publisher or speaker of any tortious
                  content posted to the Site. While We do not and cannot review
                  every message posted by users of the Service, and are not
                  responsible for any content of these messages, We reserve the
                  right, but are not obligated, to delete or remove profanity,
                  obscenities, threats of physical violence or damage to
                  property, and sensitive personal information including, but
                  not limited to social security numbers and credit card
                  information. We also reserve the right, at Our sole discretion
                  and at any time, to remove any content We may consider
                  outdated. To decide if a piece of personal information should
                  be removed, We usually try to determine whether it creates
                  significant risks of identity theft, financial fraud or other
                  specific harms. Such determination is made on a case-by-case
                  basis. In the event We believe that a removal request is aimed
                  at removal of other, non-personal information, We may deny the
                  request (please also see Our Privacy Policy, section
                  “Security”). In the event You notice any such information on
                  the Site, please report it using the “Report” button located
                  in the bottom right-hand corner under all reviews or contact
