                  emails with important notifications and updates. Write a
                  Review also offers users the opportunity to connect directly
                  with a company representative via phone, provided the company
                  is listed on the Site and we have the relevant contact
                  details. We also offer a service to U.S.-based users that

                  notify all participants that the call is being recorded and
                  transcribed. If any participant objects, the call must be
                  terminated immediately. By proceeding with the call, You also
                  consent to the collection and processing of the transcript as
                  outlined in these Terms and Our Privacy Policy, which forms an

                  If You wish to create a new account, You may do so at any
                  time. You can edit or remove Your previous posts. To edit or
                  remove Your posts, You can do this through Your user profile,
                  by submitting a notarized letter, a court order, or by
                  participating in an LVP (Legal Verification Process). You
                  acknowledge that the same rules apply to the removal of
                  cross-posts of Your posts from Our pages across all social
                  networks. For more details regarding the removal of
                  information, please visit Our FAQ for Consumers and FAQ for
                  Companies. You can also add supplemental information to a
                  review if it was created under Your account (please refer to
                  Our Privacy Policy, section “Cookies”). Write a Review is a
                  provider of the Site, which serves as an interactive computer
                  service as defined under Section 230 of the Communications
                  Decency Act. Therefore, We will not be treated as the
                  publisher or speaker of any tortious content posted to the
                  Site. While We do not and cannot review every message posted
                  by users of the Service and are not responsible for the
                  content of these messages, We reserve the right, but are not
                  obligated, to remove content that includes profanity,
                  obscenities, threats of physical violence or property damage,
                  or sensitive personal information such as social security
                  numbers and credit card details. We also reserve the right, at
                  Our sole discretion and at any time, to remove any content
                  that We deem outdated. In deciding whether to remove personal
                  information, We consider the potential risks of identity
                  theft, financial fraud, or other harms on a case-by-case
                  basis. If We believe that a removal request targets
                  non-personal information, We may deny the request (please also
                  see Our Privacy Policy, section “Security”). If You come
                  across any such content on the Site, please report it using
                  the “Report” button located in the bottom right-hand corner
